# `.about.yml` schema and tools

The `.about.yml` mechanism allows a project to publish and maintain metadata
that can be easily maintained by project owners, that is visible and
accessible to interested parties, and that can be harvested and processed by
tools and automated systems. It is implemented using the
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format.

The [18F Team API](https://team-api.18f.gov/public/api/) is the original,
primary consumer of this information, which in turn provides data for:

- [18F Hub](https://github.com/18F/hub)
- [18F Dashboard](https://github.com/18F/dashboard)
- [18F.gsa.gov](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov)

We hope that every active 18F project, [working
group](https://pages.18f.gov/grouplet-playbook/working-groups/), and
[guild](https://pages.18f.gov/grouplet-playbook/guilds/) will publish
`.about.yml` files in their respective repositories. By feeding this
information through the Team API server and into our Hub, Dashboard, and main
web site, cultivation of `.about.yml` files will help make our activity more
easily transparent to our teammates, and to anyone outside our team who wishes
to discover what we're working on (and how we work).

## Quick start

Copy the [`template.yml`](./template.yml) file from this repository into the
root directory of your project's repository as `.about.yml`. Then refer to the
[cheat sheet](#cheat-sheet) for instructions regarding how to fill in the
data.

## Installation

Run `gem install about_yml` on the command line. You can also add `gem
'about_yml'` to your project's `Gemfile` if you use
[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) and wish to configure the `about_yml_validate`
program as a pre-commit check.

## Usage

Most users will interact with the gem through one of the following
command-line programs.

### `about_yml_generate`

This program will generate an empty `.about.yml` template with descriptions of
each field. To add a new `.about.yml` file to your project where `MY-PROJECT`
is the path to your local clone of your project's repository:

```shell
$ about_yml_generate > MY-PROJECT/.about.yml
```

### `about_yml_validate`

This program checks one or more `.about.yml` files against the `.about.yml`
schema. To check your project's `.about.yml` file:

```shell
$ about_yml_validate MY-PROJECT/.about.yml
```

Alternatively, you can add the following to your `Rakefile` to tie
`.about.yml` validation into your build process (this assumes that `Rakefile`
and `.about.yml` are both in the top-level project directory):

```ruby
# Development-only tasks
begin
  require 'about_yml/tasks/check_about_yml'
  task test: :run_about_yml_check
rescue LoadError
end
```

### `about_yml_scrape`

This program checks for an `.about.yml` file in every GitHub repository
belonging to a specified organization, then downloads, validates, and
categorizes all of the discovered files into a single YAML object. You must
have a valid
[GitHub API token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/)
to run this command.

```shell
$ about_yml_scrape 18F > 18F_about_yml_data.yml
```

### `github_org_descriptions`

This program doesn't have anything to do with the `.about.yml` schema, but is
a small, handy program that also uses the
[`octokit`](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit) gem to access the GitHub API.
It will return a YAML list of names and descriptions for all of the
repositories belonging to an organization.

## `.about.yml` file testing

The `run_about_yml_check` Rake task provides a relatively simple way to check
a project's `.about.yml` file for errors.

### Add the task to your Rakefile

To test whether the `.about.yml` file for a repository will successfully parse
based on the schema, simply include the `about_yml` gem in your dependencies and
then load the task in your Rakefile:

```ruby
check_yml = Gem::Specification.find_by_name 'about_yml'
load "#{check_yml.gem_dir}/lib/about_yml/tasks/check_about_yml.rake"
```

If your project already include `about_yml`, make sure it is using version 0.0.8
or later.

### Run the task automatically with Travis

To run the `run_about_yml_check` task automatically using Travis, simply add
the following to your `.travis.yml` config file (with any preferred
notifications):

```yml
script: bundle exec rake run_about_yml_check
```
